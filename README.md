## Features

1. **KNN** : This project uses a FAISS vector database to store keys generated by a single head during forward propagation, the key-value pairs are then store in a numpy.ndarray database to be retrieved later for attention score calculation.

2. **Recurrency** : This project uses recurrency for keys and values. Each segment is allowed to access the keys and values projected by all other previous segments. The keys and queries projected by the last Decoder layer is added to the recurrency for the next segment to be used.

## Installation

To install the project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notaryanramani/mindvault.git
   ```

2. 2. Install the package.
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

    *Note* - If you encounter an error while installing torch packages, please refer [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install PyTorch for your system configuration and OS.

## Usage

This model is used to train a Decoder only Transformer that uses KNN & Recuurancy for attention score from scratch. Please refer to `main.py` file for sample code.
